632. Smallest Range

You have k lists of sorted integers in ascending order. Find the smallest range
that includes at least one number from each of the k lists.
We define the range [a,b] is smaller than range [c,d] if b-a < d-c or a < c if b-a == d-c.

Example 1:
Input:[[4,10,15,24,26], [0,9,12,20], [5,18,22,30]]
Output: [20,24]
Explanation:
List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24,26], 24 is in range [20,24].
List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20], 20 is in range [20,24].
List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30], 22 is in range [20,24].

Keep a heap of the smallest elements. As we pop element A[i][j], we'll replace it with
A[i][j+1]. For each such element left, we want right, the maximum of the closest
value in each row of the array that is >= left, which is also equal to the current
maximum of our heap. We'll keep track of right as we proceed


Time complexity : O(nâˆ—log(m)).
Heapification of M elements requires O(log(m)) time.
This step could be done for all the elements of the given lists in the worst case.
Here, N refers to the total number of elements in all the lists. M refers to the
total number of lists.

Space: O(M)
