Problem: 1
Let's say you're an environmental engineer trying to assist in laying out infrastructure
in some village. The village has N houses, each which needs a water supply.
A house can receive water if:

1. A well is built there
2. There is some path of pipes to a house with a water well

The cost to build a well at house (well_cost[i])
The cost of the pipe to connect house[i] and house[j] (pipe_cost[i][j])
What's the cheapest way to make sure every house in the village is connected to a water supply?

Problem: 2
There are N cites (1,2,3,.....,N). For each city i, you can either create a power
house or connect it through a wire to other city that has power. You're given a cost
array (Pi) of building a power house at i'th city, and cost matrix Ci-j of connecting
wire to other cities. You've to find minimum cost, such that each city will have power supply.
