1007. Minimum Domino Rotations For Equal Row

In a row of dominoes, A[i] and B[i] represent the top and bottom halves of the i-th domino.
(A domino is a tile with two numbers from 1 to 6 - one on each half of the tile.)

We may rotate the i-th domino, so that A[i] and B[i] swap values.
Return the minimum number of rotations so that all the values in A are the same, or all the values in B are the same.
If it cannot be done, return -1.

Input: A = [2,1,2,4,2,2], B = [5,2,6,2,3,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The first figure represents the dominoes as given by A and B: before we do any rotations.
If we rotate the second and fourth dominoes, we can make every value in the top row equal to 2
as indicated by the second figure.

Input: A = [3,5,1,2,3], B = [3,6,3,3,4]
Output: -1
Explanation:
In this case, it is not possible to rotate the dominoes to make one row of values equal.
